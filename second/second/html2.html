    <p>The first version of HTML was published in 1993, but the actual work on building this markup language took several years in the late 1980s and early 1990s. HTML’s foundations were laid out in CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. 

        The initial idea behind Hypertext Markup Language was to help CERN researchers organize scientific information. That’s why the earliest iterations of HTML were rudimentary and utilitarian. 
        
        In this period, computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee introduced the first set of HTML tags. These could form a basic structure that allows documents to link to each other through a nascent system of hypertext. It’s important to point out that these pioneering steps still had nothing to do with web browsers or interactive web applications we know today. 
        
        However, it soon became evident that HTML is able to transcend its scientific origins to completely change the way information is presented online'.
     
        
        HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
        HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
        HTML describes the structure of a Web page
        HTML consists of a series of elements
        HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
        HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

        <pre id="pre2">
        The DOCTYPE html declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
        The html element is the root element of an HTML page
        The head element contains meta information about the HTML page
        The title element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
        The body element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
        The h1 element defines a large heading
        The p element defines a paragraph

    All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: !DOCTYPE html.
    The HTML document itself begins with html and ends with /html.
    The visible part of the HTML document is between body and /body. 


            <u>1. Creating Your First HTML Document:</u>

                       -Identify the meaning and purpose of HTML tags.
                       -Open up a workspace for creating new HTML documents.
                       -Use a text editor to create the basic HTML structure for any web page.
                       -Insert non-displayed comments into your HTML files.
